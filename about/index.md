Hello, good day, and welcome. My name is Tim Chiang and I am an aspiring/fledgling web developer based in San Jose, CA. I have been tinkering with computers for a good portion of my life, but only fairly recently have I seriously considered making a career out of it.

<br>

In a previous era I had endeavored to join the physician ranks to heal and build others up, with my efforts culminating in interview invites from <a title="SUNY Buffalo School of Medicine" href="http://medicine.buffalo.edu">multiple</a> <a title="UC San Diego School of Medicine" href="http://som.ucsd.edu">prestigious</a> <a title="Stony Brook School of Medicine" href="http://medicine.stonybrookmedicine.edu">medical</a> <a title="Albany School of Medicine" href="http://www.amc.edu/Academic/Undergraduate">schools</a>. Unfortunately, life circumstances did not permit for me to continue on that path. The site name Timolawl is word play on <a title="Wikipedia entry - Timolol" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Timolol">timolol</a>, a nonselective beta blocker -- a remnant of and tribute to that previous chapter of my life.

<br>

Much like medicine, the web can be used to build, but more importantly, to edify. Personally, there is something immensely gratifying in knowing that I have been a positive force in the lives of others. I believe the web is unparalleled as a conduit through which individuals can create, share, and inspire. There is nothing like it, which is why I am here now.
