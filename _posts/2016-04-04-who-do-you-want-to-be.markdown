definitely still a touchy topic for me, but i hope it can serve as an encouragement for others.

Background to UCSD interview

'you know, people had to work really hard to get to where you are now..'
'you probably had everything provided for you...' 'probably had no worries'
'no struggles'

fundamental attribution error

don't ever let someone else's voice overpower your own. They don't know you. You know you.

the imagery at my SD interview

what does it mean to be equal? fairness isn't guaranteed.

you know, people
