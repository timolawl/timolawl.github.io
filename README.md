## Welcome
Welcome to the repository for my GitHub Pages site. This site was first created in January of 2016, with most major updates in that time period. The technology stack is plain HTML, CSS/SCSS, and JS with Shopify's liquid templating.

It is now mid 2017 and about two years have passed since I first started learning the basics of HTML, CSS, and JS. I certainly know a lot more now and with the experience, I can easily say I would not do things the same way as I did then.

As it stands, I have currently bumped the version with a few changes. These are rather small changes, and ultimately, I will need to make a completely new site if I want the site itself to showcase what I have learned over the years.
